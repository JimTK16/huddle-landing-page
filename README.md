### What I learned

In this challenge, I learned more about the css background-image and its related setting like background-size, background-repeat. I tinkered with the svg files and see how they would change when I change the fill and stroke properties. I thought it would be an easy challenge at first, but I did learn more by doing this one. Overall, I like to thank the FEM team to provide this challenge for us to practice.
